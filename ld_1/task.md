A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number

If the sum of proper positive divisors is less than the number then we'll call it "deficient".

If it is greater - the number will be called "abundant".

The task is to create a PerfectNumber.detect(int n) method, which for a given positive integer will return it's classification: deficient, perfect or abundant.

First, in order to understand task and debug the algorithm, create an imperative solution consisting of divisor list generator (public static Set divisors(int n)) and number classifier (public static STATE process(int n)) using the tests to verify both.
